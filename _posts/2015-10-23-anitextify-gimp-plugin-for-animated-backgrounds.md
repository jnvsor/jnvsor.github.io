So I was working on a client's site and though to myself:

> Hey! I don't know [how to make a tileable texture in the GIMP!](http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Tileable_Textures/)

Rediculous!

So I learned that.

Then because I didn't feel like working on any of the other parts of the client's site, I decided to animate it too.

Now animating something like that would be incredibly tedious to do by hand, and seemed easy enough to automate, so I popped open the python console and stumbled my way to a loop that would offset the frame to create an animation.

Thinking this would make a nice plugin - and that my python skills were rusty - I decided to learn how to make a GIMP plugin.

There are still some rough edges I'd like to clean up, but [gimp-anitextify](https://github.com/jnvsor/gimp-anitextify) works great!

## tl;dr:
